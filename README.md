During my internship, I worked on building a real-time **Client–Consultant communication platform** using **React and Firebase**. I developed this project a few months ago, and today I’m finally sharing it as part of my learning journey 😊

This project helped me understand how real-world applications handle authentication, role-based access, and real-time communication.



Client–Consultant Chat Web Application | React + Firebase 
Key Features:


Dual Authentication 
• Client login via Phone Number + OTP
• Consultant login via Email & Password

👥 **Role-Based Communication**
• Clients can chat only with consultants
• Consultants can chat only with clients

💬 **Real-Time Chat System**
• WhatsApp-like UI
• Real-time message updates & history
• Media sharing (images/files)
• Search functionality

📚 **Consultant Directory**
• Dynamic consultant search from Firestore

🔔 **Notifications**
• Real-time message alerts

🔒 **Secure Firebase Backend**
• Firestore for chat & user data
• Firebase Authentication
• Protected routes

🎨 Clean, responsive, and user-friendly UI

Working on this project improved my skills in **React, Firebase Authentication, Firestore, real-time databases, role-based access control, and full-stack application design.**
